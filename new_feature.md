The feature I attempted to add was a button that showed the best possible move for a chess game. 

This was a reasonable feature to add because it a normal feature on most websites

The feature worked, but did not give the best move, rather a good move, or a move that worked. At the beginning of the game, it gave random moves that did not put peices in their best possible possition.

ChatGPT failed to implement this feature because it did not give the best possible move and ended up breaking the game. The chess pieces did not move after the start of the game. I had to go back two generations for the game to work.
